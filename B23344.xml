            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the Important Matter of this Treatise might be a sufficient apology for the omission of a Prefatory Epistle, considering that the entire Discourse is dedicated, if not to the Readers honor, yet to their use and advantage: Notwithstanding in complyance with common custom, I shall give you a tast of your entertainment in the Porch. The design of this Treatise is the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true Goodness and Vertue, and to engage men to the practice of Religion by endeavouring to reconcile it to their
<pb facs="tcp:206297:6"/> true Interest; I should offer an affront to your Reason, if I should question your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the substance of what is here propounded; <hi>Quis nisi mentis inops—</hi> as having a tendency to make you really rich, truly honorable, divinely <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and rationally religious. I cannot augure with what resentment the style and manner of expression will be received; nor am I sollicitous concerning it; yet I suppose, that it is not so anomalous, but it will meet with some corresponding genius, whose agreeable temper may incline them to a favourable aspect even upon the exteriour part; yet if the <hi>Apples of Gold</hi> be but massie and ponderous, it is not much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial though the Pictures of Silver be tarnished and defaced. But although it be deficient in that elegance and concinnity which so worthy a Subject deserves to be embellished and fortified with, to make the more prevalent impressions upon the minds and affections of men, I shall not fail to make abundant compensation for this defect, by a supplement of Addresses to that God whose strength is made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb facs="tcp:206297:6"/> that by the perusal of this Discourse, (the fruit of my Juvenile Studies in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy from a throng of secular imployments) you may be awakened to serious endeavours after greater degrees of the Spirit of Life and Righteousness, and an inward acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the energy and power of true Religion, to the joy, peace, and serenity of your souls here, and to the consummation of your felicity hereafter. Here is no grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful entertainment for such who sport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Polemical Divinity (falsely so call'd, as if the Deity was at odds with it self, and there was a Monomachy in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity) an caress themselves only with such treatments of Religion where <hi>Eris</hi> gives the Invitation, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

<pb facs="tcp:206297:7"/> the Glory of God in all these. I shall only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise you, the late severe Dispensation of Providence towards this City occasioned the present Publication, in expectance that the minds of men may by so dreadful a Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be the better prepared for the receiving of such impressions which may better their Conversations, and inform their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which is a design worthy the utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of your friend</p>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. That the Lord Jesus Christ, and Christian Religion have been traduced. 2. Different Censures concerning it. 3. Too just Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions thereof given by the enormous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Zealous Pretenders to it. 4. Some remiss in the Practice of real Holiness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensely hot against all that is Relative, and the Contrary. 5. Some Orthodox in their Judgements take leave to Live Ill, because they Believe Well. 6. The Design of the Discourse, a Vindication of Religion from many Prejudices, with an account of the Reason for it. 7. A Representation of it as most acceptable to any man. 8. An Answer to an Objection, against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors invading anothers Office in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the present Treatise.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR blessed Lord and Saviour who did no sin, and in whose mouth was no guile found, but fulfill'd all righteousness, was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his <hi>innocence,</hi> numbred with <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:206297:8"/> and sentenced as a malefactour; so impossible is it for the most <hi>spotless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to secure himself against the <hi>calumnies</hi> and <hi>detractions</hi> of an envious and malicious Enemy. That holy <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of which, was the design of all his publique <hi>transactions,</hi> may justly <hi>complain</hi> that it is fallen under the same <hi>censure</hi> with its <hi>promoter;</hi> the reproaches of them that reproached him are fallen upon it, and it labours under the <hi>same contradiction</hi> of sinners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis by some accounted an ingenious <hi>contrivance of policy,</hi> an <hi>artifice and strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem</hi> devised by wiser heads to awe the <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and common herd</hi> of mankind to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: others allow it to be only a <hi>starch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed piece of austerity</hi> and sour <hi>Stoicism;</hi> some again dishonour it as the <hi>product</hi> of <hi>pusilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,</hi> and the <hi>index</hi> of a cowardly and <hi>degenerous</hi> mind; or <hi>traduce</hi> it as an heresie pernicious to the welfare of the Nation where 'tis entertain'd; as if its genuine and natural effect were to <hi>foment sedition,</hi> and aggravate &amp; heighten <hi>petty</hi> differences into the most <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:206297:8"/>
            <p n="3">3. How far the <hi>exorbitancies</hi> of them who have been the most <hi>zealous preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to advance Religion, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributary to the production of those noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning it, which are so derogatory from its excellence, and prejudicial to its progress, a <hi>little reflection</hi> will be too preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant an evidence; If we consider, how some have <hi>usurped</hi> its glorious Name to <hi>patronize Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Innovation,</hi> and Sainted themselves in the perpetration of the most flagitious acts both of Injustice and Impiety; as if the genius which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religion, instigated those which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd it to the most hellish enterprizes, when on the contrary, it possesseth the minds of those which give up themselves to the manuduction thereof, with the most pure and peaceable Principles, and excites them to such sacred actions as are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto. And also, take notice, many have no better <hi>title</hi> to Religion then what they can challenge by vertue of an <hi>over eager opposition</hi> against a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Party, and have no arguments to evidence their Christianity, except their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206297:9"/> being <hi>Magisterial</hi> and <hi>Dogmatical</hi> in things controverted and <hi>adiaphorous,</hi> may pass for a demonstration of it, interesting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no further in Religion then the <hi>stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing</hi> those of a <hi>different perswasion,</hi> if in matter of <hi>opinion,</hi> with the brand of <hi>Heresie,</hi> if in <hi>practice,</hi> with the style of <hi>Superstition,</hi> accounting <hi>Satyrical invectives</hi> and passionate reflections to be instances of a <hi>religious zeal</hi> for God, which are but the demonstrations of their <hi>own folly</hi> and <hi>arrogance,</hi> vainly supposing their <hi>love to God</hi> can be no better way exprest, then in their doating upon their <hi>own Images,</hi> and execrating all such notions which do not correspond with those models and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of things their fancies have suggested to the.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis an intense and violent heat wherewith many contend against all <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holiness,</hi> who may be justly suspected to be in the mean time destitute of all <hi>real</hi> inherent and personal. And others are too prone to fix the <hi>boundaries</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and circumscribe it with time and place, as if it had <hi>taken sanctuary in holy

            </p>

                  <hi>1. True Religion derives it self from God. 2. Is allied to Heaven more neerly then other beings. 3. Could not have been attained by Humane Industry or Sagacity. 4. But was discovered by God in pity to the frailty of Man. 5. By his Son Jesus Christ. 6. This laies strong obligations upon Men to embrace it. 7. Christians ought to improve it, from considering the unhappy success of Impostors. 8. Its Original argues its Excellence, and ought to quicken our Obedience. 9.

'Tis not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the world from the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but fulness of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not because God stands in need of us, but we stand in need of him. 11.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. REligion is of an <hi>heavenly</hi> descent; its <hi>extraction</hi> is from the <hi>Father</hi> of Eternity; it is not the <hi>revelation</hi> of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> the <hi>spurious</hi> and adulterous <hi>issue</hi> of humane Intellectuals, the forgerie and <hi>imposture</hi> of the <hi>Nimrods</hi> and <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avilians</hi> of the world, to <hi>acquire grandure</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> by imposing upon the less wary and <hi>over credulous</hi> natures of <hi>vulgar</hi> persons; But it is the product of <hi>unparallel'd leve,</hi> consulting infinite Wisdom concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Restitution of lapsed and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man to that Primitive estate of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and perfection in which he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. 'Tis a <hi>beam</hi> descending from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Lights, to inlighten those which sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide their feet into the wayes of peace.</hi> 'Tis the true <hi>Elixir</hi> prepared by the <hi>fire of Divine Love</hi> to <hi>project</hi> upon gross and <hi>impure matter,</hi> to refine and <hi>transmute</hi> it into a more noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>nature,</hi> and to <hi>impregnate earthy</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:206297:12"/> with a <hi>tincture</hi> of Divinity; The rays of the Sun of Righteousness ripening the Soul into a maturity for glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. Though men by the improvement of their <hi>natural</hi> parts, might have inriched their minds with many <hi>excellent notions</hi> concerning the Divine Nature and their own; yet the most <hi>sagacious</hi> and acute could never have sufficiently <hi>informed</hi> themselves of those means which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and <hi>effectual</hi> to the attainment of the chiefest good: Nor could unlock the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> of Heaven, and search the Records of Eternity, and understand the <hi>counsels</hi> of God concerning Mans Salvation. Here the <hi>light</hi> which is in <hi>Nature's darkness</hi> the <hi>Universe</hi> is still a <hi>Chaos;</hi> the name of a <hi>Mediatour</hi> is not to be found in the whole <hi>Volume</hi> of the <hi>Creation;</hi> the Scene must be changed before a Redeemer doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had not God commiserated the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of Mankind, and provided a Saviour for them, their misery had been unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to any means their utmost skill could have contrived or found out to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. He was therefore <hi>graciously pleased</hi> to make such discoveries of the way of his reconciling and recovering
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:206297:13"/> men unto him, as might be <hi>available</hi> to the attaining so blessed an end. And the whole method of restoring Man depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing solely upon the free grace and free will of God, only <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> could acquaint us with the <hi>manner</hi> of its <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The World by wisdom knew not God, but <hi>fluctuated</hi> in <hi>uncertain</hi> opinions and conjectures concerning the Providence of God, the Immortality of the Soul, and the Rewards and Punishments of the Life to come; were altogether unacquainted with the <hi>expiation</hi> of Sin by the blood of a crucified Saviour, with the washing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, with the way to Heaven by Faith, Repentance, and Charity. But he who from Eternity lay in the bosom of his Father, hath manifested the way into the holiest of all, and brought to <hi>light life</hi> and <hi>immortality</hi> by the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What more can be said to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the children of men to entertain Religion, then may be deduced from this single consideration; <hi>viz.</hi> That the sourse

From what <hi>Topicks</hi> shall <hi>arguments</hi> be fetched to prevail upon men, if they are not induced to accept and embrace Religion upon this account of its coming from the hands of God? It needs no other Letters commendatory then what it carries in its Divine Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The pretences of <hi>Mahomet, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> &amp;c. to familiarity and converse with some spiritual and holy beings, have been <hi>effectual</hi> to ingratiate those Precepts they designed should be embraced by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes. And shall <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> it self, discovering the way to bliss, be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> and disdained as fabulous or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in its Declarations, Commands, and Prohibitons, when the <hi>Narratives</hi> and Laws of Enthusiasts and Deceivers have been entertained as certain and necessary? Shall the <hi>Revelation</hi> of God have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Souls of men to improve their <hi>Intellectuals,</hi> to <hi>correct</hi> their <hi>Morals;</hi> when

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. It speaks the excellency and noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Religion, in that it proceeds from God; it cannot be <hi>presented</hi> to us at any <hi>greater</hi> advantage; This demonstrates it to be <hi>a faithful saying,</hi> and maks it <hi>worthy,</hi> as the Apostle phraseth it, <hi>of all acceptation.</hi> Its neer alliance to the Deity challengeth our <hi>greatest kindness</hi> and respect; and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflection upon this one inducement, may <hi>supersede</hi> the consideration of all those other arguments and motives our reason may suggest unto us to perswade us to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and embrace it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>1. 'Tis apparent that Religion is the Mother of Freedom. 2. The Obligation implyed in its Name no way opposite to true Liberty. 3. The Freedom of holy persons exercis'd in amorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions. 4. Sin restrains the Souls Essays to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Blessedness. 5. Religion wings the Soul, and awakens it to seek for Glory. 6. Sensual men hurried too and fro by the impetuous motions of divers Lusts. 7. Their vitious Indulgences badges of Bondage. 8. Religion restores us to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty we forfeited by our Apostasie. 9. Wicked men confined to converse with their own Jaylours. 10.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THat Liberty and Freedom are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally acknowledged to be <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> and on the contrary, Bondage and Captivity accounted of as matter of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> is a truth shines so clearly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206297:18"/> in its own light, that it needs no demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. That Religion rescues the children of men out of a state of <hi>slavery</hi> and <hi>vassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage</hi> to the power of Darkness, and asserts them into the <hi>glorious liberty</hi> of the sons of God, is as evident and perspicuous as the precedent concession; And that, in this regard it ought to be acceptable, will be the inference of any that have but the <hi>first fruits</hi> of reason, or <hi>sense</hi> enough left to put a difference between what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and ungrateful to their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There seems indeed to be something of <hi>bondage</hi> in the name of <hi>Religion,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Critism; we derive it <hi>à Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligando,</hi> but it imports no more then such ties and engagements as result from mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cognation, and can include nothing which is inconsistent with the greatest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, except we judge a <hi>child</hi> to be <hi>inslaved</hi> in its Parents <hi>arms,</hi> and a man <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned</hi> in his <hi>Friends embraces.</hi> 'Tis a Law of Love and Liberty; its silken Bonds are as Girdles and Garters, not to fetter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle, but to strengthen and adorn.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The Liberty of Religious minds is scarcely <hi>out-vied</hi> by the <hi>blessed Angels,</hi> devout and pious Souls being sometime carried on the wings of ardent desire, as directly toward God as the constraining power of the <hi>sense of Divine Love</hi> can produce <hi>reflection,</hi> acting upon Infinite Goodness with the sweetest complacency and delight, and the most unbounded free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being above those carnal checks and controllments, which debarr all unhallowed and degenerate minds from free converse with the Divinity.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

Sin lays a <hi>restraint</hi> upon those <hi>active</hi> and generous <hi>Principles</hi> wherewith the Soul of Man through the indulgence of Divine Bounty is possessed; <hi>shackles</hi> its <hi>free</hi> and Heaven-born powers, rebates that gallantry and laudable ambition by which it is promped

            <argument>
               <p>1. Honour hath ever been prized at an high value. 2. Many need a Bridle to restrain their violent pursuit of it. 3. The Stoicks accounted the practice of Vertue, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> the observance of the Law the foundation of Honour. 4. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men honoured in their alliance unto God. 5. Their Glory evident in their Wisdom and Knowledge. 6. And victorious Prowess. 7. Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power abstract from Goodness, degenerate into Craft and Cruelty. Goodness is the glory of the Divine Being, and accounted so by men. 8. Wickedness not owned by its Proselytes, till they have given it a new Name or mild Epithet. 9. Sin and Sinners represented in Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der odious and abhorrent forms. 10. Religion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth Good Men, and begets a secret esteem of them in those which are vitious. 11. The faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or scurrilous Imputations fastened upon vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, no ways really derogatory from their honor. 12. Religion an attempt adequate to the highest Ambition. 13. He that detracts from Vertue, disparageeh himself, and slights his Excellency.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1, HOnour hath the <hi>universal suffrage</hi> of all ingenious persons for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable <hi>Jewel,</hi> and worthy of the greatest

            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:206297:23"/> and impetuous is this <hi>thirst</hi> after fame and glory, that if it be not found in <hi>conjunction</hi> with Vertue, to <hi>direct</hi> it to such <hi>enterprises</hi> as truly <hi>ennoble</hi> the undertakers, and to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribe it within its just bounds &amp; limits, it doth frequently <hi>provoke</hi> the minds of men to such <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>exorbitant</hi> actions in the chace and pursuance thereof, which contract the most real <hi>infamy</hi> and <hi>reproach,</hi> and speak the <hi>narrowness</hi> and <hi>degeneracy,</hi> not the <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of the Actors Souls. What else means the unbounded <hi>ambition,</hi> the savage <hi>cruelty,</hi> the perfidious <hi>treachery,</hi> the unjust <hi>usurpations,</hi> the violent <hi>invasions,</hi> the barbarous <hi>depopulations,</hi> with many other acts of the same <hi>hellish complexion,</hi> which by History and Experience we are too sadly assured of? What except an <hi>insatiate thirst</hi> of Glory, which could not be allayed with the <hi>draught</hi> of one World, could provoke the Youth of <hi>Macedon</hi> to weep because there was not another? What but an itch of Fame could intice an <hi>Herostratus</hi> to <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> the magnificent Structure of <hi>Diana</hi>'s <hi>Temple</hi> to the bare mention of an execrable Name?</p>

            <p n="3">3. The Stoicks owned no other Honour for <hi>currant,</hi> then that which had the <hi>image</hi> and <hi>superscription</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> stampt upon it, accounting that <hi>spurious</hi> and <hi>illegitimate</hi> which was not the <hi>issue</hi> of a vertuous and <hi>heroique</hi> Soul, disdaining to lay the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of so great an excellency upon the <hi>wheel</hi> of Fortune, or the <hi>uncertain blasts</hi> of Vulgar breath, but upon so firm a <hi>basis</hi> as was sufficient to support it without being beholden to <hi>external appendices,</hi> and could maintain its luster and oriency in the want of those <hi>splendid additaments,</hi> which those that are destitute of all <hi>true</hi> and real <hi>glory pride</hi> themselves in, as essentially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the constituting of Honour, affirming Vertue not only to be its own <hi>Reward,</hi> but also its <hi>Herald</hi> too, <hi>proclaiming</hi> him that is <hi>vertuous</hi> most <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>honourable:</hi> whereas the most <hi>illustrious</hi> Titles, when they are not accompanied with those <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling imbellishments</hi> which are proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto them, are <hi>evidences</hi> of <hi>vain-glory</hi> and <hi>arrogance</hi> in those which <hi>assume</hi> them; of <hi>misprison</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> in those which <hi>attribute</hi> them, and confer no real

            <p n="4">4. Desert is the soul of Honour; the true <hi>stamp</hi> of Nobility is upon the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man.

            <p n="5">5. Whatsoever doth any way contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the rendring men famous and honourable, is in holy Writ eminently ascribed unto good and religious persons: <hi>Doth Wisdom make the face to shine, and Understanding give preheminence?

            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Pleasures</hi> of holy men are <hi>founded</hi> upon those <hi>objects</hi> which make them <hi>rival</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> in felicity; nay more, of the <hi>same nature</hi> with those wherewith <hi>the King of glory entertains himself.</hi> That <hi>correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> which there is between their <hi>Minds,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all those pure and <hi>crystalline pleasures</hi> which they do enjoy.

The most <hi>ravishing</hi> and taking delights, which the world doth <hi>prostitute</hi> to them which are her greatest <hi>favourites,</hi> are <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>fulsome,</hi> and resolved into their <hi>first principles,</hi> will appear <hi>fitter objects</hi> for <hi>disdain</hi> then <hi>desire,</hi> and rather to be loathed then lov'd. What are all their pleasures, but the product of a <hi>greedy</hi> and <hi>ravenous</hi> desire, which <hi>suppose</hi> their Souls to <hi>labour</hi> under some <hi>violent distempers?</hi> they are but the <hi>scratching</hi> of an <hi>Itch,</hi> or the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>drinking</hi> under the <hi>scorchings</hi> of a <hi>Calenture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5.

                  <hi>1. Christian Religion propounded by our Saviour as an easie yoke. 2. It doth not contain any thing prejudicial to the Body or the Mind of Man. 3. The Difficulties wherewith 'tis charged, are for the most part fictitious. 4. Wisdom is justified of her Children. 5. Ignorance a great promoter of Irreligion. 6. Experience advanceth Piety. 7. The Important matters of Religion are obvious to the meanest of them which inquire after it. 8. The Doctrine of the Gospel abused by false Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. 9. Christian Religion best known by Tryal. 10. The Duties and Vertues of it every way more grateful then the opposite Vices.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. AMong those many motives which our blessed Lord did frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon, to bring men so much <hi>in love with themselves,</hi> as those were with whom he did converse, to <hi>espouse</hi> a Doctrine which engaged them to the practice of such Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which at first sight seemed <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory</hi> to the design and scope whereunto their present Inclinations carried them; he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:206297:43"/> propounds it to them as <hi>consistent</hi> with their <hi>present Interest,</hi> and containing in it nothing repugnant to the common Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Humane Nature, his <hi>yoak</hi> being <hi>easie,</hi> and his <hi>burden light.</hi> 'Tis such a yoak which is lined through with a <hi>downie softness,</hi> and doth not <hi>press,</hi> but <hi>ease</hi> those which take it upon them. 'Tis a <hi>burden,</hi> yet 'tis no Soloecism to say 'tis <hi>light;</hi> its <hi>Onus alarum:</hi> Let the <hi>ballace</hi> rather be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the <hi>remora</hi> of the Ship, which it secures, then the burden which our Master imposes be thought heavy, to the shoulders where it lies in its greatest weight.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Were Christianity attended upon with a <hi>numerous retinue</hi> of Incumbrances, which would disturbe and unsettle the <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>harmonious</hi> temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Mind, the <hi>neglecters</hi> of it might with some <hi>colourable pretence</hi> of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>attempt</hi> to <hi>justifie</hi> their refusal, to subject themselves to the rigorous and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere injunctions of that which would so much <hi>retrench</hi> that liberty and serenity about which they are so <hi>highly sollicitous.</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:206297:44"/> But Religion comes not to <hi>prey</hi> upon our Peace, to <hi>disseise</hi> us of our Rights, to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade</hi> our Priviledges, to <hi>betray</hi> us to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, or ingulf us into a state of trouble and inquietude; or engage us unto so <hi>cruel</hi> a <hi>Discipline</hi> as <hi>Superstition</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> world for its <hi>Proselytes</hi> to submit to: There is nothing contained in it which offers any violence to the faculties of the Mind, or can be rightly interpreted to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of the Body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are no such <hi>insuperable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> and <hi>inaccessible Alpes</hi> in the way to Heaven, as the <hi>supine negligence</hi> of some suggests unto them, who have made the most impossible tasks to be emblemes of the Gospel Precepts, and cry out the <hi>burden of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>burden of the Lord,</hi> though they do not so much as touch it with one of their fingers. The <hi>Lion</hi> in this way is not so <hi>fierce</hi> as he is <hi>painted;</hi> there are no such dreadful Apparitions, no such <hi>horrid Spectres</hi> and affrighting <hi>Mormoes</hi> as are <hi>conjur'd</hi> up by the power of a <hi>deluded</hi> Imagination; the difficulties which occurr,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:206297:44"/> are not half so great as they are represented to be by them which look at the wrong end of the Perspective. These sons of <hi>Anak</hi> are not so formidable as Supposition makes them: The story of those great Giants is a <hi>Romantick</hi> Fiction: These <hi>fiery Drrgons</hi> that watch the Garden of the <hi>Hesperides</hi> are nowhere but in a Poetique Fable. Those <hi>Centaurs,</hi> &amp;c. which are so terrible, are the <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s of a teeming Fancy, and have no other being then what misapprehension doth confer upon them. Men do first draw the <hi>Picture</hi> of Religion with a sad and <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Countenance,</hi> and then take occasion to <hi>dislike</hi> it; <hi>disguise</hi> it with <hi>uncouth notions,</hi> and so keep themselves at a distance from it, and are terrified with a <hi>Vizzard</hi> of their own putting on. They cast a <hi>Mantle</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi> upon the <hi>face</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Religion to themselves in the most <hi>averting form;</hi> and no wonder if they be no otherwise <hi>affected</hi> with it; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there are many hardships to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, and great opposition to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and so give themselves a <hi>Writ of Ease</hi> from the pursance of it, without any further
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:206297:45"/> inquiry into the nature of it, making an <hi>excuse</hi> of their own <hi>slanders</hi> and jealousies: doubtless such which <hi>criminate</hi> Religion as uneasie, and except against it as harsh and rigorous, are such as never give themselves the trouble to <hi>justifie</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> their fears, by experiencing whether they were true or false; but pass a severe sentence upon it, without any other evidence then the testimony of its greatest Adversary, and their degenerate Nature suborned by him; never appealing to their own <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> nor putting it to a <hi>tryal</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> either of which would answer their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, silence their clamours, confute their fears, and <hi>vindicate</hi> Religion from that <hi>sourness</hi> and <hi>moroseness</hi> of which it is <hi>impeached,</hi> and make its <hi>unjust Judges</hi> become <hi>powerful Advocates</hi> to plead its easiness, pleasantness and desireableness.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis mens want of acquaintance with Religion deceives them into a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief concerning the conversable and acceptable nature of it; to all that know it, it appears very aimable and attractive; 'tis mens <hi>Ignorance</hi> of it is the Mother of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:206297:45"/> their <hi>want of devotion to it.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matchless <hi>Spencer</hi> is apparent, in making <hi>Ignaro</hi> Porter to the Castle of the Imposturess <hi>Duessa. Wisdom is justified of all her Children, they rise up and call her blessed;</hi> Let the <hi>Brats</hi> of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness calumniate</hi> never so strongly, when men take no other view of Religion then what they have through the <hi>Devils Opticks,</hi> 'tis no news to hear them speak of it as difficult, and <hi>decline</hi> the <hi>pursuit</hi> of it as not worth their while; but to him that hath seen it in its <hi>native excellency</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> and understands the worth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it, the greatest <hi>labour</hi> imployed about it, is a kind of <hi>recreative divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and nothing that conduceth to it esteemed a difficulty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What except <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Oscitancy</hi> could infuse into mens minds, such <hi>perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious prejudices</hi> concerning Virtue and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as is too apparent in the <hi>fatal conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences?</hi> What other causes can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed of that <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> which is so <hi>Epidemical,</hi> if these be denyed? What else could beget such <hi>practical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:206297:46"/> in reasonable creatures, and make them <hi>Antipodes</hi> to themselves? How passionately do men <hi>languish</hi> and <hi>suspire</hi> after life, yet how <hi>importunately</hi> do they <hi>court</hi> the <hi>embraces</hi> of death? At how <hi>great a value</hi> do men pretend they prize the blessings of Eternity, and the Happiness of the World to come, yet sell them at the <hi>vilest rate,</hi> and exchange their Salvation for a <hi>Penny?</hi> What <hi>kindness</hi> do men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess they have to their Souls, and how <hi>sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous</hi> will they seem to be to procure their welfare, when in the mean time they will <hi>forfeit</hi> all their happiness to <hi>gratifie</hi> a sensual desire, and expose them to <hi>eternal</hi> misery for a <hi>moment</hi> of pleasure? Speak with most men, they will tell us, the end of their being here is to glorifie and enjoy God, and prepare themselves for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the future life, when all their actions proclaim them wholly immerst in this present world: and all their designs levell'd at these sublunary vanities; as <hi>if their houses should continue for ever, and their dwelling place unto all generations.</hi> How unbecoming these contradictions are
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:206297:46"/> those active intellectual and generous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Souls, the labour of reflection will inform them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Did men enquire into, and make experience of the blessings of Religion, and lay aside those <hi>prejudices</hi> wherewith their <hi>ignorance</hi> and idleness hath <hi>prepossessed</hi> them, touching its trouble and difficulty, we should find the <hi>foundation</hi> which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi> razed, and the tents of wickedness made desolate in a moment. Religion looks upon us with a <hi>serene</hi> and <hi>pleasant Aspect;</hi> engageth us to cope with no power so great, as <hi>threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens a despair</hi> of Victoiy; puts us upon no <hi>task</hi> which shall <hi>frustrate</hi> sedulous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; it gives assistance proportionable to its commands, and allows <hi>Straw enough</hi> to make the number of <hi>Bricks</hi> it exacts from us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Fundamental</hi> Truths of Christian Religion are <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>intelligible,</hi> and its most <hi>important Duties feasible;</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with <hi>Philosophical Distinctions, Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastical Notions,</hi> thin and <hi>airy Speculations</hi> are not <hi>Essential</hi> to a Christian; a little
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:206297:47"/>
               <hi>Theory</hi> is a sufficient <hi>Basis</hi> to raise a large Structre of Piety upon. Religion, as <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> complains, is become now <hi>res inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niosa;</hi> as if it were intended more for to <hi>exercise</hi> our wits then <hi>regulate</hi> our lives; and were rather to scratch mens Itch of Disputation, then advance true Devotion, and to furnish them with <hi>Discourse,</hi> and not better their <hi>Converse:</hi> But the Doctrine of our Saviour is designed to more noble and glorious ends; 'tis to <hi>insinuate</hi> an <hi>heavenly nature</hi> into the minds of men, and effectually to <hi>ingratiate</hi> the Precepts of Virtue, and to <hi>propagate</hi> Goodness in the World; and those <hi>previous</hi> disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are indispensably necessary for the minds of men to be qualified with, for the entertainment of this sacred Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, are not a <hi>large stock</hi> of humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and natural abilities, but an <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>pacate</hi> composure of soul.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>superficies</hi> of the Gospel, at first sight presents us with so much Truth as is needful to <hi>usher</hi> in Vertue, though we should never dig into the bowels of this golden Mine, and find out those rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:206297:47"/> which are hidden there. We do much abuse our selves and injure the Doctrine of our Salvation, by framing such <hi>Idaea's</hi> of it, as are no way <hi>correspondent</hi> to the nature of it, <hi>viz.</hi> supposing it to be <hi>folded</hi> up in some <hi>inexplicable</hi> mysteries, and shadowed over with <hi>clouds</hi> of thick Darkness, or <hi>sublimated</hi> into such thin and <hi>volatile</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as are too <hi>subtil</hi> for the ken of Vulgar Understandings: Whereas the wise <hi>Legislator</hi> of the Gospel, (pardon the Solaecism) hath <hi>promulgated</hi> it in so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending a manner, that the meanest of those who are concerned in it, may be soon <hi>Doctors,</hi> of what doth immediately relate to their <hi>Obedience.</hi> Who is so <hi>Idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> as to <hi>ignore</hi> the meaning of these and the like most necessary and important truths, <hi>Without faith it is impossible to please God; Without holiness no man shall see the Lord: That God hath shewed thee O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God,</hi> &amp;c? All the Principal and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truths of Religion are writ in so fair a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:206297:48"/> character, that <hi>he that runs may read them,</hi> and he that reads may <hi>understand</hi> them. God speaks not to us in the <hi>language</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> but as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> frequently express it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap> with the <hi>tongue of the sons of men;</hi> he hath graciously <hi>accommodated</hi> his speeches to the <hi>lowest capacities,</hi> fitted truths of Scripture to the lowest understandings: We need not go to a <hi>Seer</hi> to enquire what is most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant expressions signifie, they shine so <hi>cleerly</hi> in their own <hi>light:</hi> The <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>God</hi> speak not <hi>ambiguously</hi> as the Pagan Oracles, whose sayings might be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to contrary senses; and those which <hi>consulted</hi> them left in <hi>suspence</hi> to which construction they should give credit, till oftentimes the <hi>fatal events decided</hi> it. As the <hi>conspicuous</hi> and eminently apparent Stars are sufficient to <hi>direct</hi> the Mariner which way he is to steer his course, though many of the lesser magnitude cannot be discerned without the advantage of a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescope;</hi> so those blessed Truths which are necessary for the <hi>government</hi> and regulating of our actions, are clear and <hi>visible</hi> to a

               <hi>dim</hi> eye, though there be some <hi>collateral</hi> Truths, which are not so neerly allied unto Piety, intimated in the Gospel, which are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

            <p n="9">9. The Truths of Christianity are rather adapted to <hi>Sensation</hi> then <hi>Speculation;</hi> our <hi>Sentient faculties</hi> do acquaint us with more of the nature of true Religion, then our Noetical can arrive to; 'tis better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by a <hi>lively taste</hi> and rellish, then by any <hi>artificial</hi> description. The <hi>manner</hi> of the Gospel dispensation as well as its <hi>design,</hi> argues all those to whom it is <hi>propounded,</hi> to be <hi>capable</hi> of receiving the <hi>benefits</hi> promised in it, and discharging the <hi>duty</hi> required in order thereunto.

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. An ardent desire after Happiness is intimate to our Natures. 2. The love of our Neighbour very congruous to our reasons and condition in this state of Mortality. 3. The excellency of the Law of our Saviour manifested. 4. The joy of one only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural to another. 5. The Gospel Precepts founded upon immutable Reason. 6. Gods indulgence to us in these Laws to be admired.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>Universe,</hi> and the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Creator</hi> consists in this, that all kinds of things are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>such Natures</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> as may <hi>accommodate</hi> them for the work to which they are appointed; and in that they are goverened by such laws as are <hi>suitable</hi> to the natures at first implanted in them. The most universal Principle is <hi>Self-preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> in man a <hi>rational</hi> agent, 'tis accompanied with a <hi>strong desire</hi> after a state of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and this <hi>predominates</hi> all others, which eager appetite of good is so <hi>intimately twisted</hi> into him, that he can assoon <hi>divest</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:206297:56"/> himself of his being, as of his desire of being happy. <hi>Self-love</hi> proposeth happiness as the <hi>last end</hi> of Man, and he is under no <hi>liberty</hi> of suspending his desires thereunto, but doth so necessarily, and can do no otherwise, as is evident in all men, who eagerly chace that, in the attainment of which they <hi>apprehend happiness</hi> is to be enjoyed; and because they are not firmly convinced, that their chief felicity consisteth in <hi>the favour of God,</hi> therefore do they fall in love with <hi>painted beauties,</hi> grow fond of <hi>appearances,</hi> and court whatsoever hath the shadow and <hi>semblance of good,</hi> and are tost with the <hi>vehement</hi> motions of Love and Desire, through all the false glozing excellencies of this world, finding no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which can bear any <hi>proportion</hi> to their <hi>indigence</hi> and <hi>necessities.</hi> Whereas if they were certainly perswaded that this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which they are <hi>sollicitous</hi> to procure, did consist in the fruition of <hi>God alone,</hi> they must as readily love and desire him, as hungry men eat, or the thirsty drink, and prefer him unto all things whatsoever may challenge a place in their affection;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:206297:56"/> and to <hi>direct</hi> and set aright, not <hi>eradicate,</hi> this natural inclination, is the design of the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Love of God contains nothing in it which carries not the greatest <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> to the understandings and minds of men; so neither doth that love of others which the Gospel enjoyns, include any thing which is not highly <hi>rational, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>ingenuity</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and can be dissatisfactory only to those which have exchanged the <hi>nature of Man</hi> for that of <hi>Panther</hi> and <hi>Tyger,</hi> and proclaim open war against their own <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> That golden rule of our Saviours, <hi>That whatsoever we would that men should do unto us, that we should do to them,</hi> is to mind us to act in <hi>pursuance</hi> of those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> which are deeply <hi>radicated</hi> in our Souls. Can it be called burdensom and unreasonable, to bear the same affection to another which I would have him bear to me? to put my soul <hi>in his souls stead,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> speaks; to suppose my self under those circumstances which attend him, and <hi>cloathing</hi> my self with his condition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:206297:57"/> my self towards him, as I should be heartily willing to be dealt withal, were the <hi>scene changed,</hi> and be in that state wherein I am; <hi>exacting</hi> no more of him then in such a case I my self would <hi>allow?</hi> considering that as he is in the world, so am I; that we participate of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the <hi>same blood</hi> runs in <hi>both our veins,</hi> that we <hi>are flesh of one anothers flesh,</hi> and <hi>bone of one anothers bone,</hi> and have the same <hi>relative obligations</hi> to all acts of <hi>curtesie</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> being of the same original and extraction, obnoxious to the same casualties, subject to the same passions, cloathed with the same infirmities, streightned by the same necessities, and capable of the same glorious felicity; What greater inducement can there be to love, then so much <hi>likeness</hi> and <hi>simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatsoever <hi>circumstances</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to make any <hi>Laws effectual</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,</hi> take place in the <hi>whole systeme</hi> of the Gospel Precepts; the <hi>indispensable necessity</hi> of the things commanded, their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and intrinsecal goodness,</hi> the <hi>indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:206297:57"/> right</hi> and soveraign authority of the <hi>Legislator</hi> to impose them; their <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> as <hi>eligible</hi> by such which have lived under the power of them; the <hi>greatness</hi> of that <hi>reward</hi> which is consequent upon the observance of them, and the <hi>moderation</hi> of the <hi>rigour</hi> of all penal Statutes by a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> candidly interpreting, and favourably accepting the sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of all those which cordially apply themselves to the performance of them, without any <hi>severe administrations</hi> against any offenders, except them which by their own <hi>obstinacy</hi> render themselves <hi>uncapable</hi> of the grace and mercy which is offered therein.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To give an exact account with what pleasure and ease, <hi>alacrity</hi> and <hi>activity</hi> some <hi>run the ways of Gods Commandements,</hi> is beyond anothers power. Who knows what abundance of joy and strength may be communicated to holy men by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit? or how their Souls may be enlarged in their addresses to God! A <hi>stranger intermeddles not with this joy;</hi> nor can one acquainted with its nature know
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:206297:58"/> its extent, and determine its measure. But to this every Saint subscribes his <hi>Probatum est,</hi> that <hi>it is good for to draw near to God,</hi> and that the <hi>Introduction</hi> to eternal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness, is more easie and satisfactory to vertuous and gracious souls, then are those <hi>paths</hi> of <hi>carnal pleasure</hi> which vain men so much delight in, that lead to the <hi>cbambers of death.</hi> Though men may hear <hi>much</hi> of the easiness, and delightfulness of the yoke of Christ, yet the <hi>half</hi> of it cannot be told them, when they come to experience what the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> means, and find how gracious, benign, good and profitable a yoke it is, then will they cry out concerning it, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did of the wisdom of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, The report that I have heard is true, but the one half of it was not declared to me.</hi> Though men <hi>hear</hi> never so much of the excellency of Religion, their <hi>experience</hi> will acquaint them with more then <hi>relation</hi> can make out.</p>
            <p>Three things I shall insist on, which much contribute towards the facilitating the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Gospel. 1. Their Agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to our Reasons. 2. The Assistance of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:206297:58"/> the Spirit. 3. The Assurance of a Reward.</p>
            <p n="5">5. First, The Evangelical Precepts carry a <hi>congruity</hi> to our natures, are founded upon such immutable reasons as our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings can readily assent to; they have in them an <hi>intrinsick</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> goodness, and borrow not their obligation meerly from their <hi>injunction,</hi> but are to be reckoned with those things which are commanded because they are good; not them which are good only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are commanded; under the <hi>Mosaical dispensation</hi> God made greater use of his Soveraignty, the greatest number of those Laws being <hi>Symbolical</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,</hi> having only a Positive goodness depending upon the command; they were not founded upon <hi>natural reasons,</hi> but were purely <hi>arbitrary;</hi> and the reason of them could be resolved only into the <hi>Soveraign</hi> will and pleasure of the Almighty, there being no <hi>obligation</hi> antecedent to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the <hi>matter</hi> of the Precepts being destitute of any <hi>real</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> good, and had only such which was relative, and in order to some higher end. Hence the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:206297:59"/> greatest part of those Precepts are enforced by this reason, <hi>I am the Lord;</hi> intimating his Legislative Authority to be the ground of their Obedience. Besides those two <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> duties of Divine Institution, which considering the lapse of man, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, are accommodate to our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, the holy Sacraments: All the commands of the Gospel concern the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of good and evil; they have their <hi>foundation</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, and are <hi>imitations</hi> of the <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> and have an innate tendency to the perfecting of our natures, the <hi>equity</hi> of them easily discerned, and their <hi>accommodation</hi> to their end readily apprehended. The matter of the Precepts recommends them to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance; the Laws there prescribed, being founded upon such considerations as we are naturally affected withal; that which is thus consonant to the Principles of our nature, will be found more easie to be performed then those <hi>positive</hi> Laws which seem to be given only <hi>pro imperio.</hi> The first transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was of such a command that was <hi>meerly arbitrary,</hi> whose goodness did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:206297:59"/> on the will of God; not of a law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from any natural reason.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Unless we will <hi>abjure</hi> our <hi>humanity,</hi> and call our selves by some other name then that of Man; we cannot complain of the yoke of Christ as burdensome and <hi>oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive;</hi> 'tis by interpretation to <hi>tax</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty of <hi>tyranny</hi> and cruelty in requiring us to live comformable to our nature; which is no more then this, that we which are reasonable creatures should act according to the <hi>dictates</hi> of our <hi>reasons,</hi> and live up to the heighth of our beings, which is the <hi>universal</hi> notion and agreement of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Whosoever will consult with his own soul, and attend to the <hi>deliberate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> thereof, concerning those terms upon which he stands in this life in relation to a future state, will admire and adore the <hi>indulgence</hi> and <hi>benignity</hi> of so gracious a Law-giver, in imposing no other <hi>Laws</hi> then those which have so much <hi>agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to our natures, as to carry in themselves such weighty and forcible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as are <hi>effectual</hi> to engage us to the observance of them, not only without
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:206297:60"/> complaint and <hi>reluctancy,</hi> but also with an high measure of easiness and <hi>complacency.</hi> Upon this account the Apostle styles wicked men, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 2. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Nothing can be justly esteemed difficult which conduceth to such an end; though there be an <hi>averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>reluctancy</hi> in men to make use of those means which are effectual to the procuring so great felicity; yet doth the strength of their desires and expectations <hi>reconcile</hi> them to <hi>affect</hi> the means, which without consideration of the <hi>end</hi> they so much abhorre. In the most religious and refined Souls there is so much Humane Nature left, as would <hi>recoil</hi> and start back at the appearance of some Duties which sometimes Religion may exact, if they had not respect unto the <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> and fled for <hi>refuge unto the hope which is set before them.</hi> In all secular affairs men are encouraged by the expectation of atchieving their end, to encounter with the greatest oppositions which contradict their designs.

That there is a condition of bliss reserved for the reward of such whose vertuous actions qualifie them for admission thereunto; or as the Apostle speaks, <hi>That there remains a rest for the people of God,</hi> hath been rationally inferred by the more prudent Heathens from their observation of the unequal distribution of good and evil in this world; for surveying the present oeconomy of affairs, and finding such which were most notoriously vitious, highly gratified with all those pleasures to which their sensual Appetite inclin'd them; and that the most exactly and severely vertuous, for the most part laboured under those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and necessities which were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the happiness of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

               <p>Had not self-love, vain-glory, worldly interest, and carnal indulgence given so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidences of their prevalency in other affairs, it would have been strange how that perspicuous and practical description of Christian Faith, which so frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in sacred Writ, should be so ordinarily rejected; and cloudy, and knotty, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative notions substituted in lieu thereof.</p>
               <p>The Scripture makes an hearty belief of Jesus his being the <hi>Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>the anointed of God,</hi> to be that Faith which is absolutely necessary to Eternal Happiness, as being that to which Justification and acceptance with God is promised; the full understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which would silence most of these disputes wherewith the world is disturbed concerning the Nature of Faith, and the influence it hath into the pardon of sin, and setling a man firm in the favour of God, which those will never be willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, whose sturdy and peremptory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that they are the Elect of God, is

To believe, to confess, to know, and such words of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and acknowledgement, in the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Scripture, suppose such apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and affections as are agreeable to the nature of such actions; Confession of sin includes in it a regret and repentance; and the belief that Jesus is the <hi>Christ, the anointed of God, the Prophet, the Priest,</hi> and <hi>the King,</hi> comprehends demeanour becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such faith. To attend to his voyce, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Revelations, to follow his guidance and direction, is to believe him a Prophet. A perswasion that he hath done whatsoever God required for the satisfaction of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, for the expiation of guilt, and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing divine acceptance, and that there is Salvation in no other name but his; this is <hi>to believe him Christ a Priest.</hi> A perfect subjection of our selves to his Laws, and willingness that he should reign in us by the power of his Spirit; this is to believe him <hi>Christ a King.</hi> The consideration of
